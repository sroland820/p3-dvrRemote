<p> RESEARCH:
**Images are in Repository.

Standard Controls: Power, Volume +/-, Channel +/- --PROBLEM: Too many choices, Buttons need to be bigger because they are most used and important.

Playback Controls: Play, Pause, Record, Fast Forward, Rewind, Mute, etc. --PROBLEM: These need to be color-coded appropriately and maybe have more useable features. Like selecting how much
you'd like to go forward or back or if you wanted to select a specific play-time.

DVR Shows (time shifting): View and play recorded shows --PROBLEM: Choice to see shows in APP or choose from a slider, which show to play.

Program Browsing: View current and future shows --PROBLEM: Make a slider of the images and optional view of TV guide to see what is on now or set future recordings.
